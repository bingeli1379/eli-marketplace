Daily workflow skills for Claude Code.

## Skills

### `/commit` — Commit Message Generation

Inspects staged changes and generates a [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) message, then executes the commit automatically.

- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `docs`, `style`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`
- Title: imperative mood, lowercase, under 50 chars, no period
- Body: explains "what" and "why", wraps at 72 chars, skipped for self-explanatory changes

### `/release` — Release Changelog & Version Bump

Detects the current version from project files (package.json, csproj, pyproject.toml, etc.), compares changes since the last release, generates a [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) entry, bumps the version, and commits.

- Auto-determines bump level: major (breaking), minor (feat), patch (fix/refactor)
- Changelog written from end-user perspective
- Internal refactors, CI tweaks, dependency bumps are omitted unless user-facing

### `/review-prompt` — Prompt Audit

Audits agent and skill prompt files (`.md`) for quality risks. Rates each finding as **SAFE**, **RISKY**, or **BROKEN**, then auto-fixes issues until all files pass.

- Audits: instruction completeness, code examples, templates, guardrails, cross-agent consistency, context bloat, hardcoded values, reference path integrity
- Max 3 auto-fix rounds
- Report language: Traditional Chinese (technical terms in English)
