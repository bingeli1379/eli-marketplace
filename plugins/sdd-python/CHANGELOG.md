# Changelog

## [1.1.6] - 2026-09-14

### Changed
- The agent no longer carries textbook code samples. They pulled it toward copying a typical shape instead of the one your repo already uses, which is the opposite of what it is told to do. It keeps what only it can supply: the signals that identify your stack, which skill to load for which job, and any place it overrides a bundled best-practice skill.
- The sanitized internal helper shapes are gone. They invented helpers no project actually has; the agent now confirms a helper's signature from your codebase before calling it.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- A schema or stored-procedure change the design did not record used to make the Python engineer stop and ask — but a dispatched agent has nobody to ask, so the run stalled. It now raises a `CONFLICT` signal that the orchestrator resolves with you. Its on-demand SQL skills live in the database pack; when that pack is not installed it now says so and tunes against the repo's own precedent instead of failing the load.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-08-24

### Changed
- Shorter name in the Codex plugin list — "SDD Python" instead of "SDD — Python Pack", matching the rest of the SDD family.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-08-04

### Changed
- The pack carries a name in the plugin list and is described as a stack pack, so the sdd family reads as one set rather than separate entries.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-25

### Changed
- Refreshed the bundled prompt-engineering and LLM-evaluation skills from upstream.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- The Python engineer reasons more deeply (higher reasoning effort) for more thorough implementation and review.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- New skills matched to real Python work — async/concurrency patterns, pytest testing patterns, common-mistake review, LLM prompt engineering, and LLM evaluation — loaded automatically when a task calls for them.

### Removed
- Dropped the Microsoft Dataverse skills, which did not apply to the FastAPI, data-pipeline, ML, and LLM work this pack targets.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- Initial release. Bundles the Python backend/ML engineer and its Python backend/ML skills, extracted from the sdd core plugin. Install alongside sdd (pulled in automatically as a dependency) to add Python backend/ML support to the spec-driven workflow.
