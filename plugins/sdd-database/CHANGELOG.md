# Changelog

## [1.1.4] - 2026-09-14

### Changed
- The two SQL skills drop their quick-start walkthroughs, shell commands and performance claims. They keep the rule tables, the section on shipping a schema as reviewable artifacts, and an index of which reference to read when.
- The database engineer keeps its SSDT and DACPAC conventions, its dated stored-procedure naming, its skill routing, and the rule that sends it to the vendor docs for a threshold instead of quoting one from memory.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- The schema-design and query-optimization skills pointed at `templates/*.sql` files in nineteen places, and neither skill ships a templates directory — every pointer led nowhere. They now point at the reference files that hold the same DDL, every bundled read carries its base path, and line-number citations that broke on the next edit are gone.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-08-24

### Changed
- Shorter name in the Codex plugin list — "SDD Database" instead of "SDD — Database Pack", matching the rest of the SDD family.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-04

### Changed
- The pack carries a name in the plugin list and is described as a stack pack, so the sdd family reads as one set rather than separate entries.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- **PostgreSQL depth**: work that touches JSONB columns, GIN/GiST/BRIN indexes, replication and its lag, VACUUM and table bloat, extensions like PostGIS or pgvector, or the `pg_stat_*` views now has a dedicated skill. Ordinary slow-query work still goes to the portable tuning skill.
- **SQL Server diagnosis**: when the instance itself is the suspect — timeouts, blocking, "the server is slow" — there are now ready-to-run queries for wait statistics, the heaviest queries, what is running right now, and who is blocking whom, plus what those numbers do and do not mean (wait totals are cumulative since restart; a query missing from the cache is not an innocent query; an average hides a procedure that is catastrophic for one set of parameters).
- Schema work now also produces the artifacts a reviewer can actually check: an ER diagram, row-level security policies when the design is multi-tenant, and seed data that exercises the constraints instead of the happy path.

### Changed
- Thresholds and settings for SQL Server (index maintenance, tempdb files, MAXDOP, memory) are now looked up in the official documentation and cited, rather than answered from memory — the widely repeated numbers for these are frequently the outdated ones.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- The database engineer reasons more deeply (higher reasoning effort) for more thorough implementation and review.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- Sharpened when each SQL skill activates — PostgreSQL/MySQL tuning, SQL Server/Oracle tuning, and query authoring no longer overlap — so the guidance that loads matches your database.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- Initial release. Bundles the database engineer and its database skills, extracted from the sdd core plugin. Install alongside sdd (pulled in automatically as a dependency) to add database support to the spec-driven workflow.
